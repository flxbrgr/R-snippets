R-snippets
==========

A collection of random code fragments and wrapper functions. Hopefully one day this will get some order. For now, I'll just throw stuff in here.

## `read.eurostat.R`
`read.eurostat()` imports data from the European statistics office, Eurostat. It is basically a glorified wrapper for read.delim().

## `leaflet.R`
`leaflet()` creates a map with leaflet.js from within R. It outputs a simple HTML 5 page with the map or just the `<script>` code fragment.
